Twitter bot that posts weather 
Run this python code with your personal OpenWeather API and Twitter API information to post a tweet to your twitter about the weather
can be edited by city and soon ill try and add a program to post evey 24 hours, i just got authentication this afternoon so i did this much

I uploaded my bots tweet to google NLP and it was fairly neutral, as expected.
